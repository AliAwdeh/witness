                <p>
                    On YouOwn, you will be able to use our token for buying advertisements, making it simpler for advertisers to pay and control spending on their campaigns. The content creators will get tokens as rewards directly from the advertisers from the rewards pool distributed amongst them depending on watch time and other factors, they will be able to sell their content for someone else to get the ad revenue, rent it for a price or a share of the ad revenue for someone else to use their videos and publish it and even stake their content and get loans using their video as collateral and paying it back directly from the ad revenue of the video, the loan volume depends on the revenue they get from this content that they monetized.

                <p>
                    The users are a part that cannot be ignored, and should be the ones taking decision in what matters the most. In the case of a copy right claim, users can choose if it is a legitimate issue or if it’s a fraud action, they would get rewarded with tokens. They would choose to leave an offensive video or picture for example and give the reward specific for that content to a charity that specializes in that matter. The users would report a user that is fraudulent and a voting would determine if he stays on the platform. while these users should have been active on the platform for a period, that would limit fake users to an extent. Fake users would be flagged by other users depending on their activity and would not be able to participate in the voting. Some users would be selected on a monthly basis by the platform randomly to get the “Superusers” privileges, their vote would count more than normal ones and would get a higher reward because they have more responsibility and would be audited by normal users to leave them or change them for someone else. This is a briefing of the responsibility of the users.
